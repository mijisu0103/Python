### Class Inheritance

Classes can inherit from other classes, inheriting attributes, inheriting methods â€” a way to make it simpler to modify classes and give them more capabilities

<br>

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self):
        self.num_eyes = 2

    def breathe(self):
        print("Inhale, exhale.")
        
class Fish(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
    def breathe(self):
        super().breathe() # Inherited method from the superclass
        print("doing this under water") # Added a functionality to the existing inherited method
    
    def swim(self):
        print("moving in water.")        

# Consturct an object from Fish class        
nemo = Fish()
# Call a method from a Fish class
nemo.swim()

# Inherited attribute
print(nemo.num_eyes)
# Inherited method
nemo.breathe()
```

### Inheritance Quiz

**Q1: Check the following code.**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperament = "loyal"
 
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof, woof!")
```

**How would one create a class (subclass) called Labrador that is inherited from a Dog class (superclass)?**

<br>

```python
class Labrador():
    def __init__():
        super().__init__()
        self.temperament = "outgoing"
```

```python
class Labrador(Dog):
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperament = "outgoing"
```

```python
class Dog(Labrador):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.temperament = "sarcastic"
```

```python
Labrador = Dog()
```

A1: **2nd code**

<br>

**Q2:** **Check the following code.**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperament = "loyal"
 
class Labrador(Dog):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.temperament = "gentle"
```

<br>

**What is the value that this code outputs?**

```python
doggo = Dog()
print(f"A dog is {doggo.temperament}")
 
sparky = Labrador()
print(f"Sparky is {sparky.temperament}")
```

- No value is output, this code causes an error and will not run
- A dog is loyal
    
    Sparky is loyal
    
- **A dog is loyal**
    
    **Sparky is gentle**
    

A2: **3rd option**

<br>

**Q3: Check the following code.**

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.temperament = "loyal"
 
    def bark(self):
        print("Woof, woof!")
 
class Labrador(Dog):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.is_a_good_boy = True
 
    def bark(self):
        super().bark()
        print("Greetings, good sir. How do you do?")
```

<br>

**What is the value that this code outputs?**

```python
sparky = Labrador()
sparky.bark()
```

- Greetings, good sir. How do you do?
- Woof, woof!
- **Woof, woof!**
    
    **Greetings, good sir. How do you do?**
    
- Code is not executed due to an error

A3: **3rd option**

### How to Slice Lists & Tuples in Python

### Slicing list

```python
piano_keys = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]

print(piano_keys[2:5]) # Both indexes are inclusive
# Output: ['c', 'd', 'e']

print(piano_keys[2:]) # Starting from index 2 till the end
# Output: ['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']

print(piano_keys[:5]) # Starting from index 0 till index 5
# Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

print(piano_keys[2:5:2]) # Starting from index 2 till index 5 getting every other item
# Output: ['c', 'e']

print(piano_keys[::2]) # Everything in the list but every second item
# Output: ['a', 'c', 'e', 'g']

print(piano_keys[::-1] # Reverse the list going from right to the end to the beginning
# Output: ['g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']
```

### Slicing Tuple

```python
piano_tuple = ["do", "re", "mi", "fa", "so", "la", "ti"]

print(piano_tuple[2:5]) # Both indexes are inclusive
# Output: ['mi', 'fa', 'so']

print(piano_tuple[2:]) # Starting from index 2 till the end
# Output: ['mi', 'fa', 'so', 'la', 'ti']

print(piano_tuple[:5]) # Starting from index 0 till index 5
# Output: ['do', 're', 'mi', 'fa', 'so']

print(piano_tuple[2:5:2]) # Starting from index 2 till index 5 getting every other item
# Output: ['mi', 'so']

print(piano_tuple[::2]) # Everything in the list but every second item
# Output: ['do', 'mi', 'so', 'ti']

print(piano_tuple[::-1] # Reverse the list going from right to the end to the beginning
# Output: ['ti', 'la', 'so', 'fa', 'mi', 're', 'do']
```

### Refactor snake game code using slice

```python

        # Change the font color
        self.color("white")
        # No need for drawing
        self.penup()
        # Move the scoreboard to the top of the screen
        self.goto(0, 270)
        # Write a score on the screen
        self.update_scoreboard()
        # Don't need to see the arrow as just need a score written on the screen

    def update_scoreboard(self):
        # Write a score on the screen
        self.write(f"Score: {self.score}", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)

    def game_over(self):
        self.goto(0, 0)
        self.write("GAME OVER", align=ALIGNMENT, font=FONT)

		def increase_score(self):
