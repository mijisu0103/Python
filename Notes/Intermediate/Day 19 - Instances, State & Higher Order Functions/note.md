### Python Higher Order Functions & Event Listeners

<br>

In order to be able to create a lot of games, one needs an event listeners

<br>

### Event Listeners

The code that listens to things the user does

<br>

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# Construct a turtle object
tim = Turtle()

# Construct a screen object
screen = Screen()

def move_forwards():
    tim.forward(10)

# To start listening for events
screen.listen()

# To bind a keystroke to an event
screen.onkey(key="space", fun=move_forwards) # Parentheses are only used to trigger function
screen.exitonclick()
```

<br>

<div align = center>
    <img src = "EL.gif">
</div>

<br>

### Functions as Inputs

When passing a function as an input, only pass the name without the parentheses at the end

```python
def function_a(something):
    # Do this with something
    # Then do this
    # Finally do this
    
def function_b():
    # Do this

def function_a(function_b)
```

<br>

e.g.

```python
def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2
    
def multiply(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2

def divide(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2
    
def calculator(n1, n2, func):
    return func(n1, n2)
    
result = calculator(2, 3, add)
print(result)
# Output: 5

result2 = calculator(2, 3, multiply)
print(result2)
# Output: 6
```

<br>

### Higher Order Functions

A function that can work with other functions

- The function, calculator, is a higher order function because it is actually taking another as an input, and then working with it inside the body of the function

```python
def add(n1, n2):
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(n1, n2):
    return n1 - n2
    
def multiply(n1, n2):
    return n1 * n2

def divide(n1, n2):
    return n1 / n2
    
def calculator(n1, n2, func):
    return func(n1, n2)
    
result = calculator(2, 3, add)
print(result)
# Output: 5

result2 = calculator(2, 3, multiply)
print(result2)
# Output: 6
```

### Challenge: Make an Etch-A-Sketch App

Build a Etch-A-Sketch app

1. Create a turtle that will allow one to press:
    1. W key to go forwards
    2. S key to go backwards
    3. A key to go counter-clockwise or leftwards
    4. D key to go clockwise or rightwards
    5. C key to clear drawing and put the turtle back in the center
    
<br>

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# Construct a turtle object
tim = Turtle()

# Construct a screen object
screen = Screen()

# To move forwards
def move_forwards():
    tim.forward(10)

# To move backwards
def move_backwards():
    tim.backward(10)

# To move forwards
def turn_left():
    new_heading = tim.heading() + 10
    tim.setheading(new_heading)

# To move forwards
def turn_right():
    new_heading = tim.heading() - 10
    tim.setheading(new_heading)

# To clear the screen
def clear():
    tim.clear() # Clear the turtle's drawing
    tim.penup() # Let the turtle not draw while moving to the center
    tim.home() # Locate turtle to the center of the screen
    tim.pendown() # Make turtle ready to draw again

# To start listening for events
screen.listen()

# To bind a keystroke to an event
screen.onkey(key="w", fun=move_forwards)
screen.onkey(key="s", fun=move_backwards)
screen.onkey(key="a", fun=turn_left)
screen.onkey(key="d", fun=turn_right)
screen.onkey(key="c", fun=clear)
screen.exitonclick()
```

### Object State and Instances

One can use a class or a blueprint to define what an object should appear like and how it should behave, what it has and what it can do ‚Äî taking this class and construct an actual object from it

<br>

|  | <center> Object </center> |  | <center> Class </center> |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Instance | timmy | = | Turtle() |
| Instance | tommy | = | Turtle() |


- Class is used to construct the objects called timmy
- Also got a separate object called tommy
- Timmy and tommy are both turtle objects, but they are different instances ‚Äî They can have different state
    - They can act independently
    - They can have different apperances
    - They can have different colours
    - They can have different attributes
    - They can have different speed of movement
    - They can be performing different methods at any one time
    - etc

### Understanding the Turtle Coordinate System

Build a Turtle Race

1. Asks a user to  place a bet on which turtle will win the race
2. Create six turtles, each with a distinct colour
3. Position the turtles on the left side of the screen, evenly spaced vertically

<br>

```python
from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# Construct a screen object
screen = Screen()
# Resize the screen
screen.setup(width=500, height=400)

# Take a user input
user_bet = screen.textinput(title="Make your bet", prompt="Which turtle will win the race? Enter a colour: ").lower()

# Turtle colour list
colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

# y_position of turtles
y_positions = [-70, -40, -10, 20, 50, 80]

# Looping the turtle creation to create six turtles
for turtle_index in range(0, 6):
    # Construct a turtle object, shaped as a turtle
    tim = Turtle(shape="turtle")
    # Change the colours of turtles
    tim.color(colours[turtle_index])
    # Not drawing so no need for pen to be down
    tim.penup()
    # Relocate turtle using coordinate
    tim.goto(x = -230, y = y_positions[turtle_index])

screen.exitonclick()

```
