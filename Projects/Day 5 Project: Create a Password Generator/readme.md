### Day 5 Project: Create a Password Generator

<br>

<div align = center>
   <img src = "P5.gif" width = 600>
</div>

<br>

The program will ask:

- How many letters would you like in your password?
- How many symbols would you like?
- How many numbers would you like?

<br>

The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge.
