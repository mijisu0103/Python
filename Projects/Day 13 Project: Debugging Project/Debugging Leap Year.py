# Debugging Leap Year

"""
- Read the code in the exercise.py file.
- Find a problem üêû.
- Fix the problem by modifying the program.

Modify the code to make it work. If you submit, you must pass all the tests.
This is how to check if a particular year is a leap year.

- It corresponds to any year that falls by 4 without the rest.
- Exclude all years that fall by 100 without the rest.
- However, the year should be divided into 400 without the rest.

You can copy and paste the code to PyCharm to help with debugging.
