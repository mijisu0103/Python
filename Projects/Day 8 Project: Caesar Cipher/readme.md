1. Prompt users to enter 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt it.
2. Ask users to type a message without spaces.
3. Ask users to provide a shift number for the cipher.
4. The programme outputs the encoded or decoded message based on the user's choice.
5. Ask users if they want to try again.
6. Users type 'yes' to repeat or 'no' to exit.
    1. If 'yes' is entered, the programme restarts.
    2. If 'no' is entered, the programme greets and exits.
